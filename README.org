#+TITLE: Evaluation Assignment 2

It looks to me that the illumination is applied to the ghosts, but it does not look to be working correctly. The rest of the features are ok.

Your approach to rendering is ok on efficiency, but could have been improved by the use of face culling and instancing.

Your C++ implementation is ok. There is a memory issue: in pellets you try to
delete stack-allocated memory, which should make your app crash; however it does
not crash because you don't delete the pellets (having memory leaks).

My evaluation of this work is *B*.
