#+TITLE: Evaluation Assignment 2

It looks to me that the illumination is applied to the ghosts, but it does not
look to be working correctly. The rest of the features are ok.

Your approach to rendering is efficient.

Your C++ implementation is ok. There is a memory issue: in pellets you try to
delete stack-allocated memory:

#+begin_src
~Pellet() {
    delete vertices; //Not allocated with 'new'. Cannot be subject to 'delete'
    delete XYpos;    //Not allocated with 'new'. Cannot be subject to 'delete'
 };
#+end_src

which should make your app crash; however it does not crash because you don't
delete the pellets (having memory leaks). For instance, for all these =new=:

#+begin_src txt
File: main.cpp
  33  28     Camera* cameraAdress = new Camera();
  41  20     Maps.push_back(new Map("../../levels/level0"));
  49  23     Pacmans.push_back(new Pacman(Maps[0]->getPacSpawnPoint(), XYshift));
  61  68             if (Maps[0]->getMapVal(x, y) == 0) { Pellets.push_back(new Pellet(x, y, XYshift)); }
  95  38                     Ghosts.push_back(new Ghost(it->checkCoords(0), it->checkCoords(1), true, WidthHeight, XYshift, cameraAdress));
#+end_src

there is no =delete= counterpart. Therefore, you are leaking memory.


My evaluation of this work is *B*.
